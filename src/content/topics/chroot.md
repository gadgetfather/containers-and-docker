# Chroot

Chroot (short for "change root") is a Unix system call that allows a process to change its root directory to a new location in the file system. This new location becomes the root directory for the process and its children, effectively isolating them from the rest of the system.

Chroot is commonly used in system administration and software development for various purposes, such as:

- Creating a sandbox environment for testing and debugging applications.
- Running potentially unsafe or untrusted programs with restricted access to the system.
- Building and testing software in a controlled environment.

To use chroot, you typically need root privileges. Here's an example of how to use chroot:
