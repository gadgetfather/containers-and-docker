# Starting with Docker

## Docker Desktop

I think everyone here already has a docker desktop installed. if you don't then you can download from <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/" target="_blank"> here</a>. Docker desktop runs the Docker daemon (daemon just means the program that runs in background all the time.) so that we can download, run and build containers.

For alternative you can also checkout <a href="https://orbstack.dev/" target="_blank"> Orbstack</a>.
It works with macOS 12.3+.

## Docker Hub

<a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank"> Dockerhub</a> is public registry of pre-made containers. These are images for different containers. Think of Dockerhub like a npm for containers. Instead of having to handcraft everything, you can start with container that has particular environment already setup. You can also create one and publish. We won't be doing that in session but you can try it later.

## Images

Images are pre-made containers. They just dump out the state of the container, package that up and store it so you can use it later. In simpler terms you can think of it as zip file.
